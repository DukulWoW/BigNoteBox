--
-- EDITABLE PATCH NOTES FILE
-- Update this file before each release. The WhatsNew window reads it directly.
--
-- HOW TO UPDATE:
--   1. Change `version` to the new addon version string (must match Init.lua).
--   2. Replace the `entries` table with your new patch notes.
--   3. Each entry is a plain string. Prefix lines however you like:
--        "New: ..."   "Fixed: ..."   "Changed: ..."   "Removed: ..."
--   That's it — no other files need to change for a routine version bump.
--
-- FORMAT RULES:
--   - Keep each entry to a single line of reasonable length.
--   - Plain ASCII only — no Unicode characters (they render as boxes in WoW).
--   - No markup — entries are rendered as plain GameFont text.
